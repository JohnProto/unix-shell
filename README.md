# Simple Unix Shell

This is a simple Unix shell implementation in C. It provides a basic command-line interface for executing commands.

## Features

*   **Command Execution:** Execute simple commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`).
*   **Piping:** Chain multiple commands together using the `|` operator.
*   **Redirection:** Redirect input and output using the `<`, `>`, and `>>` operators.
*   **Built-in Commands:**
    *   `quit`: Exit the shell.
    *   `chdir`: Change the current directory.
*   **Command Chaining:** Execute multiple commands in sequence using the `;` operator.

## How to Build

To build the shell, simply run the `make` command:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable file named `ask1`.

## How to Run

To run the shell, execute the following command:

```bash
./ask1
```
